# Prework Study Guide Website

## Description

This website was created for three reasons: to become a simple intro to the CSS, HTML, and JavaScript languages, to create a single space to find important notes pertaining to the three languages, and to set up a website that could mark a milestone in my coding career. It was created using Git, VS Code, and GitHub, and helped me learn many of the basics of a coding career in tech.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

The website can be interacted with in two ways: by passively viewing the notes on the main page, and by the use of the DevTools console on Google Chrome. When opening up the console while on the website, an intro message followed by the four topics learned will appear; at random, the website will select a single topic at random and display it in the console, telling the user "Let's study '____'!".

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
