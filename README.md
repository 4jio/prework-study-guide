# Prework Study Guide Website

## Description

This website was created for three reasons: to become a simple intro to the CSS, HTML, and JavaScript languages, to create a single space to find important notes pertaining to the three languages, and to set up a website that could mark a milestone in my coding career. It was created using Git, VS Code, and GitHub, and helped me learn many of the basics of a coding career in tech.

## Usage

The website can be interacted with in two ways: by passively viewing the notes on the main page, and by the use of the DevTools console on Google Chrome. When opening up the console while on the website, an intro message followed by the four topics learned will appear; at random, the website will select a single topic at random and display it in the console, telling the user "Let's study '____'!".
