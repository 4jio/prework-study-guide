        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>There are two main types of elements: elements that add content to the webpage, and elements that divide and describe the webpage.</li>
          <li>Elements that contain elements of their own are considered parent elements, while elements that are contained inside of other elements are considered child elements.</li>
          <li>Elements are entire snippets of code from the opening angle bracket to closing angle bracket, while tags are found just inside of the opening and closing angle brackets and define what type of element is being coded.</li>
          <li>Images can be added to and defined on webpages by linking a 'src=' attribute followed by a URL; 'alt=' attribute can also be added to display a string of text on the webpage in the event that the image cannot be displayed.</li>
          <li>Text can be added to a webpage by adding angle brackets around 'p' to add a paragraph/body text, 'ul' to add an bullet list, 'ol' to add an ordered list, and 'li' to add items to the list.</li>
          <li>'br' surrounded by angle brackets creates a line break in the page to separate visual webpage elements from each other.</li>
          <li>'section' surrounded by angle brackets defines a specific section in a webpage, which can be used to separate thematically different parts of a webpage into unique parts.</li>
          <li>Metadata is what defines a webpage and how it is processed by a browser, yet is not visible to the user.</li>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a programming language specifically built for designing the front end of a webpage</li>
          <li>CSS creates rules for the webpage to follow so that it displays a certain way to the user.</li>
          <li>There are 3 different methods for using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS, and external CSS.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS targets only a specific item in an HTML file and is only used in specific situations where it is more convenient to only fix one element.</li>
          <li>Internal CSS is also embedded into an HTML file similar to inline CSS, but uses 'style' surrounded by angle brackets to stylize HTML elements.</li>
          <li>External CSS is the best candidate for stylizing HTML elements, and is used by linking a stylesheet using 'rel' and 'link' surrounded by angle brackets.</li>
          <li>External CSS gives us much more flexibility for element stylization than any other CSS format.</li>
          <li>There are many different properties that we can customize for styling HTML elements, such as adjusting the margin, padding, color, and border.</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Git, a version control system, is used for local development but can be used to correspond with GitHub repositories in the cloud.</li>          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>git clone [url]: grabs a remote repository using a URL</li>
          <li>git branch: used to view all branches and indicates what branch is actively being working on</li>
          <li>git merge [branch]: used to merge a targeted branch into the active branch</li>
          <li>git log: used to view a branch's previous commits</li>
          <li>git pull origin main: syncs main branch with the new feature branch in the GitHub repo</li>
          <li>git push origin feature/[name]: pushes changes to GitHub repo</li>

        <ul>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>JavaScript allows us to use specific functions on our webpage to let users interact with the webpage.</li>
          <li>Variables can contain values, which is what allows us to create functions that interact specifically with those values in certain ways.
          <li>'console.log()' is what outputs specific strings of text into our Chrome DevTools console.</li>
          <li>'for' loops allow us to state variables and their values to utilize specific functions in JavaScript.</li>
